# tw-leads-radar — Architecture & Session Log

Backfilled 2026-08-13 from the project blueprint (blueprint_updated_11.docx)
and the repo's own corrections log (Section 11), covering Sessions 1-12.
Maintained going forward per-session alongside db/schema.sql.

## Stack

Next.js, TypeScript, Neon PostgreSQL, Vercel Hobby tier, Paddle billing,
NextAuth v4 (Google + Facebook OAuth as of the 2026-08-12 correction —
originally magic-link/email in Sessions 1-5, revised after Session 12).

## Schema (as of Session 12)

| Table | Key fields |
|---|---|
| **users** | id UUID PK, email UNIQUE, name, created_at |
| **subscriptions** | id UUID PK, user_id FK→users, paddle_customer_id, paddle_subscription_id UNIQUE, tier CHECK(free/pro/business), status CHECK(active/past_due/canceled/none), current_period_end |
| **companies** | uniform_id VARCHAR(8) PK (統一編號), entity_type CHECK(company/business), name, industry_codes TEXT[], capital NUMERIC, address_raw, address_region, address_district, responsible_person, registration_date DATE (source of truth for "new"), status CHECK(active/changed/dissolved/suspended), status_updated_at, source_dataset, source_month |
| **saved_searches** | id UUID PK, user_id FK→users, name, industry_codes TEXT[], regions TEXT[], capital_min/max NUMERIC, entity_type CHECK(company/business/both), keyword, cadence CHECK(weekly/monthly), paused BOOLEAN |
| **search_matches** | id UUID PK, saved_search_id FK, company_uniform_id FK, matched_at, surfaced_in_digest BOOLEAN, surfaced_at, UNIQUE(saved_search_id, company_uniform_id) |
| **ingestion_runs** | id UUID PK, dataset_name, source_month, row_count, new_count, updated_count, parse_failures, encoding_detected, status CHECK(running/success/failed/partial), error_log, started_at, completed_at |

RLS via `app_user` role + `app.current_user_id` session setting on
users/subscriptions/saved_searches/search_matches. `companies` and
`ingestion_runs` are not user-owned — gated at the app layer.

**Standing principle:** wherever `companies.status` is shown to a user,
an "active" reading must never imply more recency than the dissolution
dataset actually has — 商業歇業登記清冊 runs ~2 months behind the
registration datasets (confirmed in Session 11's corrections log).

## Data Flow

1. GitHub Actions (monthly) → `scripts/run-ingest.ts` → per dataset:
   `discover.ts` scrapes the data.gov.tw dataset page for the current
   latest-month CSV link → `fetch.ts` downloads it.
2. Raw files saved to scratch storage before parsing (never parse-on-stream).
3. Encoding detected + normalized per file (`normalize.ts`).
4. Address parsed into region/district (`lib/ingestion/parsing`).
5. Rows diffed against `companies` by `uniform_id` — insert if new
   (per `registration_date`), update status/fields if existing.
6. `ingestion_runs` row logged with counts and parse failures.
7. Matching engine runs `saved_searches` against newly-changed rows,
   populates `search_matches`.
8. GitHub Actions (weekly) → `scripts/run-digest.ts` — emails unsurfaced
   matches via Resend, marks surfaced.

Separately, as of 2026-08-12: a **daily** discovery pipeline
(`.github/workflows/ingest-daily.yml` → `scripts/run-ingest-daily.ts`)
queries GCIS's `Company_Setup_Date`-filtered API directly, confirmed
working unauthenticated with next-day freshness — runs alongside the
above monthly pipeline, does not replace it.

## Session Log — Sessions 1-12

**Session 1 — Project Setup**
- [x] Project scaffolded, pushed to GitHub, deployed on Vercel
- [x] All folders from Section 6 exist
- [x] `npm run build` succeeds

**Session 2 — Database Schema**
- [x] `db/schema.sql` created covering every table in Section 5
- [x] Schema runs in Neon, all indexes created
- [x] `lib/db.ts` sets `app.current_user_id` before every user-scoped query

**Session 3 — Design System**
- [x] `app/globals.css` has required CSS variables + font
- [x] `lib/utils.ts` exports `formatCapital`, `formatDate`, `cn`
- [x] Design tokens/spacing verified at mobile widths

**Session 4 — TypeScript Types**
- [x] `types/db.ts` has one interface per schema table
- [x] `types/api.ts` covers every API response shape needed

**Session 5 — NextAuth Setup**
- [x] Login/logout works end to end (originally magic-link; revised to
      Google + Facebook OAuth 2026-08-12, both providers tested live
      against real accounts)
- [x] `/(app)/*` routes blocked when logged out
- [x] `users` row created on first login, not duplicated on repeat
- Correction (Session 10): `callbackUrl` was hardcoded to `/searches`
  in the old magic-link flow — fixed by threading it through properly.
- Correction (2026-08-12): default fallback changed from `/searches`
  (never a real route) to `/searches/new` (the actual Session 13 page).

**Session 6 — Ingestion: Fetch Layer**
- [x] `discover.ts` scrapes all 6 data.gov.tw dataset pages for the
      latest-month CSV link — verified against 2+ real datasets
- [x] `sources.config.ts` lists all 6 dataset PAGE URLs, not direct
      CSV oid links (those are fixed to one month forever — see Section
      11 correction predating this session)
- [x] `fetch.ts` downloads to scratch storage, not parse-on-stream
- [x] `ingestion_runs` row created with `status='running'` before each
      download
- [x] `scripts/run-ingest.ts` runs standalone via tsx, no time limit
- [x] `.github/workflows/ingest.yml` triggers monthly
- [x] Failure notification exists, not just a dashboard to check
- Correction (Session 10): `run-ingest.ts` only ever called `fetch.ts`,
  never chained into `normalize.ts`/`upsert.ts` — fixed, re-verified
  end-to-end for real (not just recompiled).

**Session 7 — Ingestion: Encoding & Normalization**
- [x] `normalize.ts` correctly detects UTF-8 vs Big5
- [x] Every parse failure logged with the raw line, none silently dropped

**Session 8 — Address Parser**
- [x] `parseAddress()` handles all 22 縣市 plus both 台/臺 variants
- [x] Test file passes for 15+ real-format addresses
- [x] Unparseable addresses return null rather than a guess
- [x] District-level miss rate logged against the test set

**Session 9 — Diff & Status Logic**
- [x] New companies insert correctly; existing companies update in place
- [x] Status transitions apply correctly per `source_dataset`
- [x] "New" detection uses `registration_date`, not file-membership —
      directly proven against a real existing `uniform_id` (status
      flip confirmed, `registration_date` untouched via COALESCE)
- [x] Writes happen in chunked batches, not one row at a time

**Session 10 — Ingestion Admin Dashboard**
- [x] `/admin/ingestion` reachable only by the owner account
- [x] Dashboard flags a dataset that should have run this month
- [x] Dashboard shows last known-good `source_month` per dataset, plus
      the two pipeline/login fixes logged above

**Session 11 — Attribution Component**
- [x] Attribution renders correctly for all 6 datasets in the footer
      (visually verified in-browser, character-checked against the
      required 政府資料開放授權條款-第1版 credit line)
- [ ] Inline attribution anywhere company data is shown directly —
      explicitly deferred, not falsely marked done (per Session 11's
      own corrections entry)

**Session 12 — Marketing Pages**
- [x] Landing page explicitly states monthly cadence (this is now
      partially superseded — see 2026-08-12 monetization-pivot
      correction in the blueprint's Section 11: freshness-gated tiers
      replace the original feature-gated free/paid framing, and
      pricing copy needs revisiting to reflect daily/weekly/monthly
      tiers rather than a flat "monthly" statement)
- [x] Pricing page reflects Section 7 tier limits (same caveat as above)
- [x] Privacy/Terms pages exist and linked in nav
- [x] All page copy in Traditional Chinese
- [x] No marketing copy frames the product around its data source

## Known open items carried into Session 13+

- `/searches` (bare index) is not a defined route anywhere in the
  blueprint — only `/searches/new` (Session 13) and `/searches/[id]`
  (Session 14) are ever specified. Not a bug; just don't expect a page
  at the bare path.
- Session 11's inline-attribution objective remains genuinely
  incomplete, not just unchecked.
- Session 12's pricing copy needs a rewrite once the freshness-tiered
  model (2026-08-12 correction) is implemented in Session 18/19's scope.
- A stray `cookies.txt` file is committed at the repo root (leftover
  from manual API testing) — harmless but should be `.gitignore`d and
  removed.
